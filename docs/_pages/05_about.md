We are two engineers fascinated by AI based in Canada and Europe. We have created this website to present our findings on the exciting topic of adversarial examples.

Studying this topic raised our awareness of how differently humans and machines approach a vision task. Computer vision systems already outperform humans on specific tasks like [pneumonia detection from x-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05225). These tasks however are quite narrow and require a lot of examples to learn these representations.

Humans seem to rely more on common sense when approaching a vision task. We think this would also be the best defense against adversarial examples. With that we mean that a human for example would infer from the situation of a manipulated stop sign on an intersection that there is something “wrong” with the stop sign and act accordingly.

We are very excited about how the field of computer vision will evolve and approach these and many other problems and are looking forward to contributing to it.
