FGSM is fast, but not always effective. Works most of the time.

BIM is a more effective version of FGSM by completing the calculations iteratively. It was able to succeed in 100% of the samples with very little perturbance.

DeepFool is even more effective in creating adversarial examples with even less perturbance than BIM.
