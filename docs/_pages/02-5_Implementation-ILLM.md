title: Iterative Least Likely Method

---

Both of the previous methods only try (they donâ€™t guarantee a false classification) to change the prediction to a different class. When attacking a classifier with a lot of similar classes this can lead to uninteresting results. For example, one dog breed would be classified as another dog breed but not as a cat. The Iterative Least Likely Class Method (ILLM) from [Adversarial Examples in the Physical World]((http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533)) looks at the prediction on a clean image and modifies it to output the least likely class.

Similar to BIM a clean image $$X$$ is used for initialization in iteration $$N=0$$:

\begin{equation}
\tag{3.1}
\widetilde{X}_{0} = X 
\end{equation}

The fast step is similar to BIM. Instead of using the loss with regard to the correct class the least likeliest class $$Y_{LL}$$ is used:

\begin{equation}
\tag{3.2}
X^{\prime}\_{1} = \widetilde{X}\_{0} - \alpha sign(\nabla\_{X} J(\widetilde{X}\_{0}, Y\_{LL}))
\end{equation}

As in equation 2.3 the adversary is generated by finally clipping the pixel values:

\begin{equation}
\tag{3.3}
\widetilde{X}\_{1} = min \( 255, X + \epsilon, max \( 0, X-\epsilon, X^{\prime}\_{1} \)\)
\end{equation}

These steps are repreated $$N$$ times. For the hyperparameters $$\alpha$$ and $$N$$ the authors use the same values as for BIM.
