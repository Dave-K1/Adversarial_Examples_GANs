Recent advances in neural networks for example for image recognition or text recognition have lead to broader adoptions. However, it has been shown that most of these networks are vulnurable to attacks with adversarial examples [1]. These are inputs, for example an image, which has been modified in such a way that the classifier predicts a wrong class. Attacks with adversarial exampels even work through sensors like cameras [2] which makes it important for example for autonomous vehicles.

In addition to adversarial examples there are GANs [3].

The goal of this repository is to explore the state-of-the-art in adversarial examples, defense mechanisms and GANs. The repository is split into two parts. The first section focuses on example generation, attacks and defense mechanisms. In the second part we deal with GANs
