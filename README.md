# Adversarial Examples and Generative Adversarial Networks

This is the [project website](https://daved01.github.io/Adversarial_Examples_GANs/) for the two repositories Adversarial Examples and GANs. The website provides a review of selected literature as well as details about the implementation of common methods. 

## Implementation
As dataset 1000 examples from [NIPS 2017: Adversarial Learning Development Set](https://www.kaggle.com/google-brain/nips-2017-adversarial-learning-development-set#categories.csv) are used. These images are similar to the ImageNet dataset. The data is not part of this repository and has to be downloaded separately. To access the data a Kaggle account is required.

As a model we use a pretrained GoogleNet.
