# Adversarial Examples and Generative Adversarial Networks

The goal of this project is to explore the state-of-the-art in adversarial examples, defense mechanisms and GANs. The repository is split into two parts. The first section focuses on example generation, attacks and defense mechanisms. In the second part we deal with GANs. The findings are discussed [here](https://daved01.github.io/Adversarial_Examples_GANs/).


Two datasets are used:

1. MNIST dev set with 10,000 examples
2. Dataset with 1000 examples from [NIPS 2017: Adversarial Learning Development Set](https://www.kaggle.com/google-brain/nips-2017-adversarial-learning-development-set#categories.csv). Examples are similar to the ImageNet dataset.
